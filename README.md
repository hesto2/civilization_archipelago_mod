# Archipelago mod for Civlization VI
### Description
This project contains the base files needed in order to run Civilization VI with the [Archipelago Randomizer](https://archipelago.gg).

### Usage
1. Click the green "Code" button in the github user interface and then "Download as Zip".

2. Extract the zip file into a separate folder. This will be referred to as the folder containing the mod.

3. After the Archipelago host generates a game, you should be able to download a "NewItems.xml" file. After downloading the file, move it into the folder containing the mod.

4. Once you have the NewItems.xml file moved, you can copy the folder containing the mod to your Civ VI mods folder. On Windows, this is usually located at `C:\Users\YOUR_USER\Documents\My Games\Sid Meier's Civilization VI\Mods`
